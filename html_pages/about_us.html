                        Brooklyn Roasting Company was founded by Jim Munson in Williamsburg,
                         Brooklyn in 2009. Jim had previously held executive-level management
                          positions at The Brooklyn Brewery and Dallis Bros Coffee.
                           From the start, the Company’s goals were simple:
                            To provide NYC with best quality,
                             sustainably-sourced coffees presented to consumers unpretentiously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within two years,
                         the Company opened its flagship roastery and retail operation
                          at 25 Jay Street in Dumbo on Brooklyn’s historic coffee waterfront.
                           Today, Brooklyn Roasting Company is New York City’s leading homegrown coffee
                            business, operating a handful of cafes in New York City and servicing hundreds
                             of high-end wholesale accounts in the five boroughs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our core commitments to diversity in the workplace and progressive
                         Fair Trade purchasing standards set us apart from our competition.
                          We are particularly proud of the many strong relationships we have forged with
                           vendors, coffee farmers, employees and customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe that making delicious coffee is a fundamentally simple proposition:
                         Grind freshly-roasted, high-quality beans into clean brewing equipment and
                          add near-boiling filtered water. Wait a couple of minutes and voila!
                           A perfect cup of piping-hot coffee. Our employee and wholesale
                            training programs stress the importance of trusting your senses rather than
                             relying upon digital equipment. Developing a feel for how to create flavor in
                              a cup is paramount.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our business philosophy is easily summarized:
                         We are serious but not snobby, practical not pretentious,
                          accessible not exclusive. Like Brooklyn, we are bold, brave,
                           colorful and creative. The outline of our logo, like the boundaries of
                            the borough of Brooklyn, never changes, but what’s inside
                             —the colorful characters of our coffees, our customers, and our employees—
                              is always changing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe coffee is an inspirational beverage and supports the life of the mind
                         in general. Our commitment to supporting local institutions,
                          like the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Brooklyn Museum, the New York Public
                           Library stand out as examples. We celebrate Brooklyn’s centuries-old coffee
                            heritage and aim to advance it in our own inimitable way.
